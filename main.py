                and this includes some sentences having periods while others do not, varying fonts, varying font sizes,
                make sure the document is black and white and has no images. Next, I want you to look at the content of 
                the resume. This includes seeing if everything is in the right order, with most recent experiences being at
                the top, make sure each bullet starts with an action verb and is in the past tense if the experience ended,
                and the present tense if it is ongoing. Finally, I want you to give them industry specific advice, improvements
